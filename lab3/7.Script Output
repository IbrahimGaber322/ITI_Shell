7. What is the output of the following script
typeset –i n1
typeset –i n2
n1=1
n2=1
while test $n1 –eq $n2
do
n2=$n2+1
print $n1
if [ $n1 –gt $n2 ]
then
break
else
continue
fi
n1=$n1+1
print $n2
done

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer:

The script has a logical error. It will result in an infinite loop because the while condition ($n1 –eq $n2) is always true. The script doesn't increment $n1 and $n2 in a way that would make the condition false.
